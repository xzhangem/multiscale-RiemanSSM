# Implementation of "Landmark-Free Anatomical Shape Analysis Using Explicit Latent Codes Learned from Deformation-Specific Shape Metric and Multiscale Training"  

Motivation: The project is motivated by application the theory of second order Sobolev shape metric (IJCV 2023, https://github.com/emmanuel-hartman/H2_SurfaceMatch) and its T-PCA version Bera-esa (IJCV 2024, https://github.com/emmanuel-hartman/BaRe-ESA) to medical shape data. However, we find that directly usage of this fancy theory to some high-deformed dataset where each sample may vary a lot from the others, such as pancreas dataset, will not obtain satisfying results. Therefore, we advance the original Bera-esa with multiscale training stragety, and its performance becomes great and can is tested better than sevaral existing results.
